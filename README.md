- 👋 Hello, I’m @dar1an

- I’m interested in mobile app and software development. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning learning to code in Swift and looking to slowly but surely develop a few apps that are coming soon. 

- 😁 I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I am eager to learn and would love to get my hands on a project and try my best to add my insight for the benefit of the 
project. 

- 📫 The best way to reach me is by emailing me at darianhthomas26@gmail.com
